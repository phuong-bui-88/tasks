- [x] Create setCurrentFilter function in TaskContext
- [x] Connect Calendar component to TaskContext filtering
- [x] Update Calendar navigation to trigger filtering
- [x] Ensure tasks are filtered when the application first loads
- [x] Make sure tasks are filtered when the month changes in the calendar

## Completed Features

### Month/Year Filtering
The application now defaults to showing tasks for the current month and year.
When a user navigates through the calendar, tasks are automatically filtered to show
only tasks with due dates in the selected month and year.

### Calendar Integration
The calendar component is now fully integrated with the task filtering system.
Clicking on previous/next month buttons or the "Today" button will update both 
the calendar display and the filtered task list accordingly.
