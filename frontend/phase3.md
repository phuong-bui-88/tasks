# Phase 3 - CSS to Tailwind Migration

## Authentication Components

### Tasks

- [x] Convert Login.jsx to use Tailwind CSS instead of traditional CSS
- [x] Fix styling issues in RegisterPage.jsx buttons using Tailwind 
- [x] Remove unused Auth.css file (can be removed as it's now replaced by Tailwind)
- [x] Ensure all auth components have consistent styling

### Benefits of Tailwind Migration

1. **More maintainable code** - no need to manage separate CSS files
2. **Faster development** - write styles directly in the JSX
3. **Consistent design system** - using Tailwind's predefined design system
4. **Smaller bundle size** - only the used utility classes are included in the final build
5. **Better responsive design** - Tailwind's responsive utilities make it easy to design for different screen sizes

### Next Steps

- Consider adding dark mode support to all auth components
- Implement consistent form validation feedback using Tailwind classes
- Create reusable Tailwind components for common UI elements (buttons, inputs, etc.)
