# Phase 7: Task Management API Integration

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] Review backend API documentation for task structure
- [x] Update TaskEditForm component with start date field
- [x] Ensure proper status values in TaskEditForm (1=PENDING, 2=COMPLETED)
- [x] Update CreateTaskForm component with start date field
- [x] Update CreateTaskForm with status dropdown (mapped to 1=PENDING, 2=COMPLETED)
- [x] Update TaskItem component to display start date
- [x] Update TaskItem to properly display numeric status values
- [ ] Test form submissions with new fields
- [ ] Verify API integration with updated fields

## API Notes

According to the backend API documentation:

1. Tasks need both a start date and a due date
2. Task status values in API response/request:
   - 1 (numeric) = PENDING 
   - 2 (numeric) = COMPLETED
3. Task creation endpoint requires proper payload format
4. Task update endpoint expects all fields to be provided

## Implementation Details

Tasks need to include:
- Title
- Description
- Start Date (required field)
- Due Date (required field)
- Priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Status (numeric: 1 = PENDING, 2 = COMPLETED)
