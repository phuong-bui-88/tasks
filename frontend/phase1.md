# CSS to Tailwind Migration Checklist

## Components
- [x] Create migration checklist
- [x] Convert UserProfileDropdown.css to Tailwind
- [x] Convert tasks.css to Tailwind
- [x] Update TaskItem.jsx to use Tailwind
- [x] Update TaskEditForm.jsx to use Tailwind
- [x] Confirm Sidebar.tsx Chakra UI compatibility (No changes needed as Chakra UI already uses a utility-first approach)

## Progress Notes
- Migration complete
- Added custom animations to tailwind.config.js for dropdown and fadeIn effects
- Kept Sidebar.tsx with Chakra UI as it's compatible with the Tailwind approach
